- Here are some papers on the restricted mean survival time (RMST).  
I recommend that this be included in all Moffitt clinical trials as something to be measured.  As a default, a 12 month end-time seems reasonable.  However, the PI of the protocol should select what time they think is best.  In a single-arm study, I don‚Äôt think there is any major problem with the end time choice.  If it is used for a comparison trial, the end time could matter considerably.

- Here are the key papers on the debates about the efficiency of the Kaplan-Meier method. Meier et al discuss the restricted mean survival time in section 3.2, which perhaps led to its popularity today.

- Dr. L.J. Wei from Harvard has made significant contributions to RMST research. I had the opportunity to attend one of his talks at the Mayo Clinic, which I found particularly insightful. I‚Äôm attaching one of his works, ‚ÄúOn the Restricted Mean Survival Time Curve in Survival Analysis‚Äù, which may be of interest.
I wanted to mention that, RMST is a fundamental concept in survival analysis, extending beyond clinical trials. Its applications are relevant to all cancer studies where survival analysis is of interest, including retrospective observational cohort studies. In fact, I‚Äôd recommend first applying it to observational cohort studies to build a strong foundational understanding before boarder implementation.

- Completely agree that RMST holds significant value in clinical research. However, given the complexity and costs associated with clinical trials which are more rigorously, prospectively designed, I believe it would be beneficial to first explore the practical utility of RMST in retrospective observational studies. This step-by-step approach would allow us to:

    - Establish a solid understanding of RMST as a fundamental concept in survival analysis (whose application is beyond just clinical trials).
    - Assess its applicability in studies where OS or PFS is of interest, especially given that many Moffitt trials rely on response-type endpoints for signal finding.
    - Use retrospective observational studies as a flexible platform to explore and refine RMST (e.g., determining the appropriate cut-off time) before broader implementation in prospective trials.

If you have any retrospective cohort studies where RMST could be a good fit, I‚Äôd be happy to collaborate and explore its application. This could help build domain expertise and generate data-driven evidence to inform our future Moffitt clinical trials. üòä
